# Loot Manager

purpose: Create a loot generator that I can play with and modify for dnd 3.5 based on the rules 
outlined in the dungeon masters guide, and other resources. As well as serving to practice and 
in a sense document on use of entity framework (And possibly api) creation.

Notes: 
    
- Each enemy out of the Monsters Manual has a treasure rating used in generating treasure.
- Treasure chart is found on page 52 of the dungeon masters guide
  - Roll for coins, Gems, and Items based on percentage.
  - Gem notes on Page 55
  - Mundane Items (Includes weapons and Armour) notes on Page 56
  - Anything above Mundane starts in magic items.
  - Magic Items on 216 ( covers armour and shields, )

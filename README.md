# Loot Manager API

This is an api that I'm developing to eventually plug into at least a discord both for roll treasure in dnd (specifically 
3rd edition). Some of the design choices come from wanting it to be user friendly to use from discord bot commands.

__TODO:__  
    +   ~~Get running in Docker~~   
    +   ~~Coin end point~~   
    +   ~~Coin Roller end point~~   
    -   Acceptance tests
    +   Goods

Current issues:
    - Laptop only: When running in docker, containers are unable to communicate. Issue does not exist on desktop. Unsure of cause,
    Settings seem to be configured correctly.
